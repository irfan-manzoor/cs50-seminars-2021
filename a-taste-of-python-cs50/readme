a taste of Python, a popular programming language introduced in CS50x and then used again in CS50’s course on web programming (aka CS50W) and CS50’s course on artificial intelligence (aka CS50AI). We’ll introduce you to some building blocks of programming, including “functions,” “return values,” “variables,” “conditions,” “loops,” and more. And you’ll write some of your own programs!Taught by CS50’s own Brian Yu.
